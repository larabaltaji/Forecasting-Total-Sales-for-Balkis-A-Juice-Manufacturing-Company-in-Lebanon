# Forecasting Total Sales for Balkis: A Juice Manufacturing Company in Lebanon

This project aims to develop a statistical model for forecasting the monthly sales of fresh juice produced by Balkis Company in Lebanon. Different models were applied to analyze and forecast monthly sales data from January 2000 to October 2019 for a Juice Manufacturing Company in Lebanon. The data includes factors such as season of the month and branch location. The model's performance is evaluated based on its ability to accurately predict sales for up to 24 months ahead, from 2019 to 2021. The results demonstrate that the MAA ETS model produced the lowest RMSE, indicating excellent forecasting accuracy. The model's parsimonious use of parameters further enhances its suitability for forecasting fresh juice sales.
